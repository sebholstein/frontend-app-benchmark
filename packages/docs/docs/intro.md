# Intro

The _Frontend App Benchmark_ tries to capture Lighthouse performance stats of "real-world" frontend applications built with several frontend frameworks/libraries.

To have a fair comparison, every application has to implement the same features, has to use the same data, and gets hosted/benchmarked on the same machine. With these techniques, we try to create a fair benchmark environment for every application. (See ["The Benchmark Process"](#the-benchmark-process) for more details)

Everyone is invited to add new applications or to improve the existing applications. See the `/apps` folder for all existing applications.
If you want to add a new application, please read the ["Adding a new project"](#adding-a-new-project) section.
